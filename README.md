# FUSA_ISO26262
FUSA basic overview

🔍 Difference Between ASPICE and ISO 26262
Aspect	ASPICE (Automotive SPICE)	ISO 26262 (Functional Safety)
Purpose	Focuses on software development process quality	Focuses on functional safety of automotive systems
Scope	Software engineering lifecycle: requirements, design, implementation, testing, etc.	Safety lifecycle: hazard analysis, risk assessment, safety requirements, validation, etc.
Standard Type	Process assessment model (based on ISO/IEC 15504)	Safety standard (based on IEC 61508)
Compliance Goal	Improve process maturity (e.g., ASPICE Level 2 or 3)	Ensure safety compliance (ASIL levels: A to D)
Key Outputs	Process capability levels, work products, traceability	Safety goals, safety requirements, safety mechanisms, safety case
Used By	Automotive OEMs and suppliers to assess software development quality	OEMs and suppliers to ensure safety of electrical/electronic systems

✅ How You Might Ensure ISO 26262 Compliance in a Project
Based on your experience with ADC drivers, DTCs, and AUTOSAR, here’s how ISO 26262 compliance is typically ensured:
1. Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment
	• Identify potential hazards (e.g., overheating due to ADC failure).
	• Determine ASIL (Automotive Safety Integrity Level) based on severity, exposure, and controllability.
2. Safety Requirements Derivation
	• Define Functional Safety Requirements (FSRs) and Technical Safety Requirements (TSRs).
	• Example: “ADC must detect over-temperature within 100ms and trigger DTC.”
3. System and Software Architecture
	• Design safety mechanisms (e.g., redundancy, plausibility checks).
	• Use AUTOSAR Safety Extensions if applicable.
4. Implementation with Safety Measures
	• Use safe coding practices (MISRA C/C++).
	• Implement diagnostics (e.g., DTCs for sensor faults).
	• Ensure memory protection, watchdog timers, etc.
5. Verification and Validation
	• Perform unit testing, integration testing, and safety validation.
	• Use tools like Polyspace for static analysis and Trace32 for debugging.
	• Ensure coverage of safety requirements.
6. Safety Case Documentation
	• Document all safety activities, rationale, and evidence.
	• Create a Safety Case to demonstrate compliance.
